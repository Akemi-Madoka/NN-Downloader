# NN-Downloader

Welcome to the successor of the [multporn image downloader v1][2] & [v2][1] and most downloaders out there regarding "NSFW" material. The NN-Downloader or Naughty-Naughty-Downloader (yes very creative I know) supports multiple sites with their official API (if available), and proxies and it's also portable.

This project is unfinished and only works on the [listed][13] sites currently. More Documentation and other gibberish are planned.
